        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>
          Nature refers to the interaction between the physical surroundings around us and the life within it like atmosphere, climate, natural resources, ecosystem, flora,
           fauna, and humans. Nature is indeed God’s precious gift to Earth. It is the primary source of all the necessities for the nourishment of all living beings on Earth. Right from the food we eat,
           the clothes we wear, and the house we live in is provided by nature. Nature is called ‘Mother Nature’ because just like our mother, she is always nurturing us with all our needs.

        <h2>Section Two</h2>
        <p>
          Nature is an important and integral part of mankind.
           It is one of the greatest blessings for human life;
            however, nowadays humans fail to recognize it as one.
             Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets, writers,
              artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation
               inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it.

        <h2>Section Three</h2>
        <p>
          Nature has been in existence long before humans and ever
           since it has taken care of mankind and nourished it forever. 
           In other words, it offers us a protective layer which guards 
           us against all kinds of damages and harms. Survival of mankind
            without nature is impossible and humans need to understand that.

          If nature has the ability to protect us, it is also powerful 
          enough to destroy the entire mankind. Every form of nature,
           for instance, the plants, animals, rivers, mountains, moon, 
           and more holds equal significance for us. Absence of one
            element is enough to cause a catastrophe in the functioning of human life.
